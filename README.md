# OSDU Development

This repository contains my work for the Operating System course. The focus of this project is to implement core concepts of operating system design and development by having hands-on experience in developing a simple operating system of our own (OSDU).

## Project Overview

In this project, I engaged in:

- Developing key operating system functionalities.
- Implementing process management, memory management, and file system operations.
- Designing system calls and handling inter-process communication.

## Features

- Implementation of process scheduling algorithms.
- Memory allocation techniques.
- A simple file system with basic operations.

## Getting Started

To run the project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow the instructions in the documentation to set up the development environment.
3. Explore the provided code and experiment with the functionalities.

## Conclusion

The OSDU project demonstrates my understanding of operating system principles through practical implementation.
